After downloading it, run the bootstrapper file to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual Studio.

After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting the feature sets—or workloads—that you want. Here's how.

## Part 2 Remotely Connecting
1. Preparation: 
There is a first step you need if you’re on Windows: install a program called OpenSSH, which is a program that can connect your computer to other computers that have this kind of account: Use this link
[link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

Then, look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:

2. Open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl + `, or use the Terminal → New Terminal menu option). Your command will look like "$ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
", but with the zz replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.
3. If it is your first time you've connected to this server, you will receive a message like

⤇ ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

Type 'yes' and enter, give your password. Then you will see this:
